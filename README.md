# ES6 Boilerplate

Essential starting package to work with es6 modules using webpack and babel.


# Starting from scratch

It's needed to build our projects
```
npm i webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server -D
```

It's needed if we need to run in older versions
```
npm i babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env -D
```
